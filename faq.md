- Q: Why are the drawings so weird? 
  - A: Weird drawings are interesting. If you want a printer, go get a printer. 
- Q: Can it draw any faster??
  - A: Yes, the default Dobot settings can be overwritten to exceed the recommended accelerations and speeds. I did not increase the speed for any of these drawings to reduce jostling of the camera and improve reliability. 
- Q: Why didn't you use *Machine Learning*? 
   - A: To use machine learning, you need a way to grade the performance of each set of parameters. To have the robot teach itself how to draw "well," I would first have to teach it how to judge art. This would turn my simple coding project into philosophical and technical nightmare and would probably not work.
