- Q: Why teapots and Danny Devito?
  - A: Why *not*.
- Q: Why are the drawings so weird?
  - A: Weird drawings are interesting. The intent of the project is not to recreate images perfectly.
- Q: Can it draw any faster?
  - A: Yes, the default Dobot settings can be overwritten to exceed the recommended accelerations and speeds. The default speed settings were not changed for any of these drawings to reduce jostling of the camera and improve reliability.
- Q: Can you change out the pen?
  - A: Yes, any pen with small enough diameter to fit into the end effector can be used easily. The pens are held in place with set screws and can be swapped out with a screwdriver in less than a minute. Ballpoint pens work well because they layer nicely and do not bleed ink too quickly.
- Q: Why didn't you use *Machine Learning* to optimize the drawings?
   - A: To use machine learning, you need a way to grade the performance of each set of parameters. To have the robot teach itself how to draw "well," it would need to quantitatively assess art. This would open a philosophical and technical can of worms beyond the scope of this project.
