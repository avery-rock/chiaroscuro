- Q: Why teapots and Danny Devito? 
  - A: Why *not*. 
- Q: Why are the drawings so weird? 
  - A: Weird drawings are interesting. If you want a printer, go get a printer. 
- Q: Can it draw any faster?
  - A: Yes, the default Dobot settings can be overwritten to exceed the recommended accelerations and speeds. The default speed settings were not changed for any of these drawings to reduce jostling of the camera and improve reliability. 
- Q: Why didn't you use *Machine Learning*? 
   - A: To use machine learning, you need a way to grade the performance of each set of parameters. To have the robot teach itself how to draw "well," it would first need to know how to judge art. This would turn a simple coding project into philosophical and technical nightmare and would probably not work.
