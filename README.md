This project was inspired by Patrick Tresset's [*Human Study #2, La Vanit√©*](http://patricktresset.com/new/project/human-study-2-la-vanite/), an art installation that places several simple robots at old fashioned wooden desks while they produce scribbly sketches. Tresset's work has several key features that were vital to capture in this homage.  

1. The robots never draw the same way twice.
2. The robots render both edges and shading. 
3. Intricate drawings are built up from small scribbles. 

While the final style presented in this project does not perfectly recreate the effect of Tresset's work, Chiaroscuro produces work with a similar uncanny blend of mechanical precision and expressive disorder.
