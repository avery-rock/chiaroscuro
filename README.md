 This project was inspired by Patrick Tresset's [*Human Study #2, La Vanit√©*](http://patricktresset.com/new/project/human-study-2-la-vanite/), a robotic performance art installation featuring several drawing robots. Tresset's work has several key features that are emulated in this homage.

1. Scenes are never drawn the same way twice.
2. Sketches include edges and *shading*. 
3. Intricate drawings are built from small, discontinuous scribbles. 

While the final style presented in this project does not perfectly recreate the effect of Tresset's work, *Scratch* produces work with a similar uncanny blend of mechanical precision and expressive disorder.
