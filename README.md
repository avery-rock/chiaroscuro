This project was inspired by Patrick Tresset's [*Human Study #2, La Vanité*](http://patricktresset.com/new/project/human-study-2-la-vanite/), an artistic installation piece that places several skeletally simple robots at old fashioned wooden desks while they produce scribbly sketches of whatever is placed in front of them. This piece has several key features that make not only its output but also its process fascinating. 

1. The robots never draw the same way twice.
2. The robots render both edges and shading. 
3. Intricate drawings are built up from small scribbles. 

While the final style presented in this project does not perfectly recreate the effect of Tresset's work, it produces work with a similar uncanny blend of mechanical precision and artistic disorder. 

Tresset has other, better-documented work that was only found late in the process of developing this project. The technical details were not used in developing my work. The image processing techniques used are qualitatively very similar to the methods I found worked well but are, naturally, far more refined. The work presented in papers [like this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849313000149) will offer an avenue for further improving the planning and processing steps if I work on this project further after this semester.
