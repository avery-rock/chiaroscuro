*Scratch* is a still life drawing robot that makes stylized, scribbly sketches of its surroundings using a ballpoint pen.

 This project was inspired by Patrick Tresset's [*Human Study #2, La Vanit√©*](http://patricktresset.com/new/project/human-study-2-la-vanite/), a robotic performance art installation featuring several drawing robots. Tresset's work has several key features that are emulated in this homage.

1. The robots never draw the same way twice.
2. The robots render both edges and shading. 
3. Intricate drawings are built up from small scribbles. 

While the final style presented in this project does not perfectly recreate the effect of Tresset's work, *Scratch* produces work with a similar uncanny blend of mechanical precision and expressive disorder.
